# CryptoClustering (Machine Learning)

This challenge is comprehensive and engaging, covering a range of important concepts in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. This challenge is centered around a real-world problemâ€”predicting the impact of price changes on cryptocurrencies, making it relevant and practical. 

I started by Loading data, obtaining summary statistics, and visualizing the dataset provide a solid foundation for understanding the dataset before diving into more complex tasks. Further, normalizing data using the `StandardScaler()` is a crucial step in preparing the data for clustering algorithms. I used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). In this data set, I found optimal number of k-clusters is 2. 

Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to gain valuable insight in this large dataset, as it's a common technique for dimensionality reduction. The impact of using fewer features (PCA) provides us with better clusters for greater clarity. I used hvPlot for data visualizations, as it provides an interactive and informative way to explore and interpret the results. Comparing the elbow curves from the original data and PCA analyzed data, shows us that even though PCA reduces the dimensions to smaller set while still maintaining as much variance in the data.

This challenge effectively combines theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation, providing learners with practical experience in data analysis and unsupervised learning.
